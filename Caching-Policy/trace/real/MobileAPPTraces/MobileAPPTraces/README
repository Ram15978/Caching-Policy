The 15 traces are collected from 15 mobile applications with different time periods. All the 15 mobile applications are running on the Google Nexus 5 smartphone with Android 5.0.1 and Linux Kernel 3.4. The trace file-names are indicating different mobile applications and some file-names also include the running hours. 

Each record in the trace files is as follows:

[Time in s] [R or W] [LBA] [size in 512 Bytes blocks] [pid] [process] [MD5 per 4096 Bytes]


More details about the mobile applications and how the traces are collected can be found in our published paper, as follows:
